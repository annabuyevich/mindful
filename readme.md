We created a website to bring awareness to people who are having trouble with their mental health. About 44 million Americans do not have access to health care, which enables them to get the proper care that they need. We wanted to create a space where they can get help even if they do not have the means to go get counseling or help form a professional. On this website they will able to track their mood by journaling and participating in mindful activities. We hope that navigating through the various activities will help improve their mood overall. In order to see these results, we have implemented the Microsoft face API which will detect the patient's mood/feelings at all times. This will help patients who have a hard time expressing their thoughts and feelings. Depending on how they are feeling, they will be presented with an array of activities and valid feedback that they can use. Some of the activities include meditation, breathing exercises, life talks, and doing actual exercises like going for a walk. In the journaling activity a semantic analysis was used to pick up on certain trigger words written that may be concerning. Once the program picks up the specific words, it will redirect the patients to many different resources that they can access in order to help them. Some of these resources include information about the University of Illinois Counseling Center, group therapy sessions, and individual counseling sessions. We hope that this website will be of aid to those who may be scared to seek help or those who cannot afford it.
