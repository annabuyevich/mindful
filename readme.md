**Mindful**

#### Our Goals
We created a website to bring innovative assistance to people who are struggling with their mental health. About 44 million Americans do not have access to health care, which inhibits many from getting the proper mental health care they may need. We wanted to create a solution that provides resources and wellness activies for those who do not have the means to go to counseling or recieve help from a professional. On this website, users will able to track their mood, journal, and participate in mindful activities. We hope that navigating through these various components will help improve a user's overall mood. 

#### How it Works
In order to guide a user's journey through our website, we have implemented the Microsoft Face API. We use this API to detect and track the user's mood/feelings after participating in activies. This will help us recommend resources and activies for users who may have a hard time expressing their thoughts and feelings. Some of the activities we will recommend include meditation, breathing exercises, wellness talks, and physical exercises like going for a walk. In the journaling activity, a sentiment analysis was used to identify entries with negative sentiment. Once the program identifies a particular sentiment, it will redirect users to various resources that can provide the assistance that they may need. Some of these resources include information about the University of Illinois Counseling Center, group therapy sessions, and individual counseling sessions. We hope that this website will be of aid to those who may be hesitant about seeking help or cannot afford it.
